Status for Havok Script decompiler
==================================

The decompiler's development started around November of 2022. It has
gone through a few redesigns over time while the general approach has
remained the same, that approach being to do 2 passes on the bytecode,
generating block information in the first pass, and then doing symbolic
execution and dumping output in the second pass. But at one point, the
2 passes turned into 2 sets of passes. The actual number of bytecode
passes may be more than 2, but the idea is that there is an internal
interface between the 2 sets of passes. The first set of passes is
contained in the function `pass1', and the second set is in `pass2', and
the internal interface dictates what data `pass1' is required to
generate, and what data `pass2' shouold expect to exist by the time it
runs.

I've made a lot of progress on generating variable info when not using
debug info, but I have yet to test hksc without debug info.

With debug info, all unit tests are passing.

With debug info, all test programs are passing.

Without debug info, all pass1 unit tests are passing.

One thing I know that I have not yet addressed is detecting/handling
assignment conflicts.
