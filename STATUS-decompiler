Status for Havok Script decompiler
==================================

The decompiler's development started around November of 2022. It has
gone through a few redesigns over time while the general approach has
remained the same, that approach being to do 2 passes on the bytecode,
generating block information in the first pass, and then doing symbolic
execution and dumping output in the second pass. But at one point, the
2 passes turned into 2 sets of passes. The actual number of bytecode
passes may be more than 2, but the idea is that there is an internal
interface between the 2 sets of passes. The first set of passes is
contained in the function `pass1', and the second set is in `pass2', and
the internal interface dictates what data `pass1' is required to
generate, and what data `pass2' shouold expect to exist by the time it
runs.

I've made a lot of progress on generating variable info when not using
debug info, but I have yet to test hksc without debug info.

With debug info, all unit tests are passing.

I am working on getting the test programs passing with debug info.

One thing I know that I have not yet addressed is detecting/handling
assignment conflicts.
