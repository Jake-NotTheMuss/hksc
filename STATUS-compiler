Status for Havok Script compiler
================================

All implementation for the base compiler is done, not counting a couple
of Havok Script extensions that I could not find any implementations for
because I could not find any games which enable those extensions.

The only other thing I am concerned with is implementing my own
extensions to the compiler to further optimize code. One extension I
have thought of is allowing programmers to specify table sizes when
writing table constructors. The programmer could provide a desired
array-size and hashtable-size for the table without providing as many
elements to reach those numbers naturally. This would make more
convenient the initialization of large tables with many values that
start out as nil without having to write out all of the nil elements.

The syntax might be as follows:
	local t = {} : 100, 200;

Where 100 is the array-size, and 200 is the hashtable-size.
