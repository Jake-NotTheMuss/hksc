TODO for Hksc

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Maintainer Suggestions

** Decompiler sections
ldecomp.c is massive even in its incomplete state. It may be easier to read
and maintain if it were split up into different files.

** Analyzer tag
Get rid of the tagged Analyzer structure. It doesn't need to be part of
garbage collection. Its fields could be moved to ldecomp.c::FuncState, and the
FuncStates could all be allocated at once as a stack, where the size is
D->maxtreedepth. This way, if an exception is thrown, all the FuncStates can
still be accessed and all the memory can be freed before returning from
luaU_decompile.

** Decompiler Tests
Add decompiler tests to hksctest.c
